## Description
* An application to learn Chinese BPMF.
* This was my first attempt in developing an application, without proper foundations (no design pattern implemented, no best practices implemented)
* This README file currently shows 2 stages of this application as I learn to develop with time. 
* Available in the App Store.

## Frameworks
* SwiftUI

## What I Learned

* After coming back from UIKit, I also went back to learn SwiftUI properly. During this time, I learned and understood the concept of property wrappers. State, Binding, ObservedObject, StateObject, EnvironmentObject, and ObservableObject Protocol became clear. 
* Refactoring code in SwiftUI is much like re-using views.
* Application of MVVM decoupled the code. The interface is similar, but under the hood I believe the code is much improved.

## Frameworks
* SwiftUI
* GoogleMobileAds

## What I Learned

* Since I dove head first into SwiftUI without foundations, I needed to go back and learn foundations thoroughly to understand Swift architecture. Went on a journey to learn UIKit & Storyboard after building this app.
* Basic SwiftUI; Stacks, Spacers, Navigation Links, State Variables, Toggles, Pickers, Sliders.
