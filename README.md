## Description
* An application to learn Chinese BPMF.
* This was my first attempt in developing an application, without proper foundations (no design pattern implemented, no best practices implemented)

## Frameworks
* SwiftUI
* GoogleMobileAds

# What I Learned
* Since I dove head first into SwiftUI without foundations, I needed to go back and learn foundations thoroughly to understand Swift architecture. 
* Basic SwiftUI; Stacks, Spacers, Navigation Links, State Variables, Toggles, Pickers, Sliders.
